## 🛠️ Installation Requirements

### 🆕 Absolute Beginner Setup (Start Here)
If you have never coded before, follow these steps first!

**Step 1: Install Visual Studio Code (The Editor)**
- Download and install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). This is where you will write code and run commands.

**Step 2: Install Anaconda (The Manager)**
- Download [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (a lightweight version of Anaconda).
- This tool allows us to create isolated "playgrounds" (environments) for our code so different projects don't break each other.
- **Windows Users**: During install, check "Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable" (even if it says not recommended, it makes things easier for beginners).

**Step 3: Install Git (The Downloader)**
- **Windows**: Download [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
- **Mac**: Open the "Terminal" app (Cmd+Space, type Terminal) and type `git`. If not installed, it will ask to install developer tools—say yes.

**Step 4: Get the Code**
1. Open your terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows).
2. Type this command and hit Enter:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nazirlouis/ada_v2.git
   ```
3. This creates a folder named `ada_v2`.

**Step 5: Open in VS Code**
1. Open VS Code.
2. Go to **File > Open Folder**.
3. Select the `ada_v2` folder you just downloaded.
4. Open the internal terminal: Press `Ctrl + ~` (tilde) or go to **Terminal > New Terminal**.

### ⚠️ Technical Prerequisites
Once you have the basics above, continue here.

### 1. System Dependencies

**MacOS:**
```bash
# Audio Input/Output support (PyAudio)
brew install portaudio
```

**Windows:**
- No additional system dependencies required!

### 2. Python Environment
Create a single Python 3.11 environment:

```bash
conda create -n ada_v2 python=3.11
conda activate ada_v2

# Install all dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install Playwright browsers
playwright install chromium
```

### 3. Frontend Setup
Requires **Node.js 18+** and **npm**. Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) if not installed.

```bash
# Verify Node is installed
node --version  # Should show v18.x or higher

# Install frontend dependencies
npm install
```

### 4. 🔐 Face Authentication Setup
To use the secure voice features, ADA needs to know what you look like.

1. Take a clear photo of your face (or use an existing one).
2. Rename the file to `reference.jpg`.
3. Drag and drop this file into the `ada_v2/backend` folder.
4. (Optional) You can toggle this feature on/off in `settings.json` by changing `"face_auth_enabled": true/false`.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration (`settings.json`)

The system creates a `settings.json` file on first run. You can modify this to change behavior:

| Key | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `face_auth_enabled` | `bool` | If `true`, blocks all AI interaction until your face is recognized via the camera. |
| `tool_permissions` | `obj` | Controls manual approval for specific tools. |
| `tool_permissions.generate_cad` | `bool` | If `true`, requires you to click "Confirm" on the UI before generating CAD. |
| `tool_permissions.run_web_agent` | `bool` | If `true`, requires confirmation before opening the browser agent. |
| `tool_permissions.write_file` | `bool` | **Critical**: Requires confirmation before the AI writes code/files to disk. |

---

### 5. 🖨️ 3D Printer Setup
ADA V2 can slice STL files and send them directly to your 3D printer.

**Supported Hardware:**
- **Klipper/Moonraker** (Creality K1, Voron, etc.)
- **OctoPrint** instances
- **PrusaLink** (Experimental)

**Step 1: Install Slicer**
ADA uses **OrcaSlicer** (recommended) or PrusaSlicer to generate G-code.
1. Download and install [OrcaSlicer](https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer).
2. Run it once to ensure profiles are created.
3. ADA automatically detects the installation path.

**Step 2: Connect Printer**
1. Ensure your printer and computer are on the **same Wi-Fi network**.
2. Open the **Printer Window** in ADA (Cube icon).
3. ADA automatically scans for printers using mDNS.
4. **Manual Connection**: If your printer isn't found, use the "Add Printer" button and enter the IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.50`).

---

### 6. 🔑 Gemini API Key Setup
ADA uses Google's Gemini API for voice and intelligence. You need a free API key.

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2. Sign in with your Google account.
3. Click **"Create API Key"** and copy the generated key.
4. Create a file named `.env` in the `ada_v2` folder (same level as `README.md`).
5. Add this line to the file:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
6. Replace `your_api_key_here` with the key you copied.

> **Note**: Keep this key private! Never commit your `.env` file to Git.

## 🚀 Running ADA V2

You have two options to run the app. Ensure your `ada_v2` environment is active!

### Option 1: The "Easy" Way (Single Terminal)
The app is smart enough to start the backend for you.
1. Open your terminal in the `ada_v2` folder.
2. Activate your environment: `conda activate ada_v2`
3. Run:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. The backend will start automatically in the background.

### Option 2: The "Developer" Way (Two Terminals)
Use this if you want to see the Python logs (recommended for debugging).

**Terminal 1 (Backend):**
```bash
conda activate ada_v2
python backend/server.py
```

**Terminal 2 (Frontend):**
```bash
# Environment doesn't matter here, but keep it simple
npm run dev
```

---

## ✅ First Flight Checklist (Things to Test)

1. **Voice Check**: Say "Hello Ada". She should respond.
2. **Vision Check**: Look at the camera. If Face Auth is on, the lock screen should unlock.
3. **CAD Check**: Open the CAD window and say "Create a cube". Watch the logs.
4. **Web Check**: Open the Browser window and say "Go to Google".
5. **Smart Home**: If you have Kasa devices, say "Turn on the lights".

---

## ▶️ Commands & Tools Reference

### 🗣️ Voice Commands
- "Switch project to [Name]"
- "Create a new project called [Name]"
- "Turn on the [Room] light"
- "Make the light [Color]"
- "Pause audio" / "Stop audio"

### 🧊 3D CAD
- **Prompt**: "Create a 3D model of a hex bolt."
- **Iterate**: "Make the head thinner." (Requires previous context)
- **Files**: Saves to `projects/[ProjectName]/output.stl`.

### 🌐 Web Agent
- **Prompt**: "Go to Amazon and find a USB-C cable under $10."
- **Note**: The agent will auto-scroll, click, and type. Do not interfere with the browser window while it runs.

### 🖨️ Printing & Slicing
- **Auto-Discovery**: ADA automatically finds printers on your network.
- **Slicing**: Click "Slice & Print" on any generated 3D model.
- **Profiles**: ADA intelligently selects the correct OrcaSlicer profile based on your printer's name (e.g., "Creality K1").

## ❓ Troubleshooting FAQ

### Camera not working / Permission denied (Mac)
**Symptoms**: Error about camera access, or video feed shows black.

**Solution**:
1. Go to **System Preferences > Privacy & Security > Camera**.
2. Ensure your terminal app (e.g., Terminal, iTerm, VS Code) has camera access enabled.
3. Restart the app after granting permission.

---

### `GEMINI_API_KEY` not found / Authentication Error
**Symptoms**: Backend crashes on startup with "API key not found".

**Solution**:
1. Make sure your `.env` file is in the root `ada_v2` folder (not inside `backend/`).
2. Verify the format is exactly: `GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key` (no quotes, no spaces).
3. Restart the backend after editing the file.

---

### WebSocket connection errors (1011)
**Symptoms**: `websockets.exceptions.ConnectionClosedError: 1011 (internal error)`.

**Solution**:
This is a server-side issue from the Gemini API. Simply reconnect by clicking the connect button or saying "Hello Ada" again. If it persists, check your internet connection or try again later.

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

| Aspect | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| **API Keys** | Stored in `.env`, never committed to Git. |
| **Face Data** | Processed locally, never uploaded. |
| **Tool Confirmations** | Write/CAD/Web actions can require user approval. |
| **No Cloud Storage** | All project data stays on your machine. |

> [!WARNING]
> Never share your `.env` file or `reference.jpg`. These contain sensitive credentials and biometric data.
